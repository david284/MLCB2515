# Arduino library for MERG MLCB running over CAN bus

A library that implements the abstract MLCB base class. It contains methods to support the MCP2515/25625 CAN controller IC

Note that this library depends on a number of other libraries which must also be downloaded:

MERGLCB 		- abstract MLCB base class
ACAN2515		- low-level interface to the MCP2515 CAN controller IC
Streaming		- C++ style output

## Hardware

Currently supports the MCP2515 and MCP25625 CAN controller ICs via the ACAN2515 library
